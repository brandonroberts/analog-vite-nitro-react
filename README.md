# React + Vite + Analog + Nitro

This is an example React application using the Vite/Nitro plugin from [AnalogJS](https://analogjs.org). The `@analogjs/vite-plugin-nitro` package can be used with any Vite-based application to provide:

- Hybrid Server-side Rendering
- Static Site Generation
- API Routes

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the application dependencies.

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application automatically reloads if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the client/server project. The client build artifacts are located in the `dist/analog/public` directory. The server for the API build artifacts are located in the `dist/analog/server` directory.
